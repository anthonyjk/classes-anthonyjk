         * Parsing is separating a sequence of characters into tokens based on

         *    Delimiters are characters that separate tokens
         *        (by default, white space is the delimiter).
         * 
         * When we create a scanner object, we have to specify the input stream
         *    (e.g., System.in which is the keyboard via the terminal).
